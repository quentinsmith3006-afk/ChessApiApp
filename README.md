# **Chess API App**
This chess API app utilizes QChessV2 and the stockfish API to add bots to play with.

The purpose of this project is primarily for practice in collaboration on GitHub and version control, resume building and to have atleast 1 use of QChessV2.

This project is purely collaborative so, for the most part, neither party does more than the other.
